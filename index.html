        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            I'm an incoming freshman at Indiana University Indianapolis, majoring in Computer Science. My journey so far has been shaped by more than academics, it's been defined by discipline, resilience, and a deep love for the game of football. Over the past four years, I poured my heart into the sport, learning what it means to lead, to be accountable, and to push through adversity. The field taught me how to connect with others, communicate under pressure, and grow into the kind of person others can count on.<br><br>
            Away from the stadium lights and the classroom, I find peace casting a line. Fishing has become my favorite way to slow down and reconnect with myself. It has a way of slowing life down just enough for me to catch my breath and clear my head. It's taught me that progress doesn't always come with noise or speed. Sometimes, it's about showing up early, staying patient, and trusting things will come together if I stick with it. There's a calm in the waiting, and I've learned to appreciate those quiet, in between moments not as empty space, but as time to reflect and reset. Out there, with just the water and my thoughts, I've become more intentional in how I tackle problems. I'm less rushed and more focused. I've learned that the journey matters just as much as the outcome, and that some of the best lessons come when I least expect them.<br><br>
            As I prepare to begin my college journey, I'm excited to bring those values with me. I'm happy to be blending technical curiosity with grounded leadership, and using every moment whether fast paced or calm as fuel for growth.
